    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Programming Algorithms & Software Testing</h1>
    <h3>Phases of computer program developement:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
        <li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
        <li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
        <li>Phase 4. Enter the program and save</li>
        <li>Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
        <li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
        <li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Programming Structures</h3>
    <p1><b>Sequential structure</b>: Top-down execution<br/>
        <b>Decision structure</b>: if/then/else<br/>
        <b>Iterative</b>(Looping):
        <ul>
            <li>while loop: continue looping as long as something is true</li>
            <li>repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true</li>
            <li>for loop: loop a given number of times</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Recursive structures</b>:
            <ul>
                <li>Repeat a set of instruction as a subtask of itself</li>
                <li>Repitition continues until:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met</li>
                        <li>(degenerative case is also called a "base case")</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
    </p1>
            
    <h3>Two classic programming/database problems</h3>
    <p1>      
        <b>Sorting</b>: Descending order/Ascending order
            <ul>   
            <li>Sorting numbers</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria</li>
                <ul>
                <li>In database:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Filters: temporary search</li>
                        <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
    </p1>
    <h3>Two popular search techniques:</h3>
	<p1>
        <b>Sequential search</b>: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time<br/>
        <b>Binary search</b>:
            <ul>
                <li>only works if data is SORTED first</li>
                <li>start in the middle, then go to half of that, ect.</li>
            </ul>
    </p1>
    <h3>Two classic program goals:</h3>
	<p1>
        <b>Efficiency</b>: Program takes minimal time and/or resources<br/>
        <b>Correctness</b>: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions
