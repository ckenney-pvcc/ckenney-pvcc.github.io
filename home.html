        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The ability for Congress to tax was given by the Constitution [6]. 
            Congress does this by enacting federal laws contained within Title 26 also known as the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
            U.S. Code Title 26: Internal Revenue Service codifies all federal tax laws [7]. 
            This means that Title 26 systematically arranges all of the federal tax laws such as income, employment, alcohol, trust fund, and estate taxes into one code. 
            This code is the source of all of the tax laws in the United States [7]. 
            These laws are implemented by the Internal Revenue Service using its system of treasury regulations and revenue rulings [7]. 
            The Treasury Regulations and the Court are responsible for interpreting the Internal Revenue Code because of its complexity [1]. 
            Title 26 also details under which circumstances the Internal Revenue Service can disclose federal tax returns and return information to other federal agencies[7]. Title 26 is divided into several sections.
        </p>
        <h2>Treasury Regulations</h2>
        <p>Regulations are often referred to as Federal Tax regulations [2]. 
            They give the official interpretation of the Internal Revenue Code by the U.S. Department of Treasury. 
            They also give taxpayers directions so that they are able to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code [2].
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The history of the Internal Revenue Service is a long one. 
            The foundation of the current Internal Revenue Service was established in 1862 when, in order to raise revenue for the civil war, President Lincoln signed a revenue-raising measure into law. 
            This measure created not only Americaâ€™s first income tax, but also the first commissioner of internal revenue. U.S. tax laws were beginning to be codified in 1894. 
            Congress was given the power to establish a federal income tax by the 16th Amendment. This amendment was passed by Congress on July 2, 1909. 
            It was ratified on February 3, 1913 [5]. 
            In 1918, due to rising World War I efforts, the Revenue Act of 1918 was passed and it created a progressive income tax that taxed up to 77 percent.
            The Internal Revenue Code was compiled in 1939, but major changes were made by Congress to Title 26 in the years 1954 and 1986[4]. 
            The changes in 1954 included changing the filing deadline for personal income tax from March 15 to April 15 [4]. 
            In 1953, President Eisenhower changed the name of the Bureau of Internal Revenue to the Internal Revenue Service. 
            The changes made in 1986 were significant. In 1986, President Reagan signed the Tax Reform Act [4]. 
            This act contained 300 provisions that took three years to implement. For the third time since the Revenue Act of 1918, this act codified the federal tax laws [4]. 
            Because of the extent of the changes made in the year 1986, Title 26 became largely known as the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [7]. 
            </p>
        <h2>The Internal Revenue Service</h2>
        <p>The internal revenue service is the organization that is responsible for carrying out the responsibilities of the Treasury Secretary as outlined by the Internal Revenue Code section 7801. 
            The U.S. Treasury Secretary has many responsibilities that include managing national debt, helping to formulate policies that are significant to the economy, and formulating/ recommending economic, financial, and tax policies internationally and domestically [4]. 
            The Department of Treasury is the parent agency of the Internal Revenue Service. This organization was created to administer and enforce the laws detailed within the Internal Revenue Code [5]. One important example of one of the duties of the Internal Revenue Service is enforcing that taxes are paid. 
            The IRS can do this by issuing a notice of levy on salary, other income, or property in order to satisfy tax debt [3].
